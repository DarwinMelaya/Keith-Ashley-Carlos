          <h3>Shawarma</h3>
          <p>
            Shawarma is a popular Middle Eastern dish made from thinly sliced,
            marinated meat (usually chicken, beef, or lamb) that is slow-cooked
            on a vertical rotisserie. It's typically served in flatbread, like
            pita, and garnished with vegetables, sauces, and condiments.
